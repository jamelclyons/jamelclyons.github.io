<p>I have structured each project to allow for new iterations while providing clarity on my development and operations work. A project may include an ID, title, description, solution, process, problem, owner, and details. Every project starts with a problem, and the process is documented along the way to a solution.</p>

<p>The process includes status, design, development, and delivery. The status reflects the project's progress based on the number of completed tasks. Each task has a weight, and the total weight is calculated by summing up all the task weights. The percentage of completion is determined by dividing the total weight of completed tasks across the process (design, development, and delivery) by the total weight of all tasks (design total weight + development total weight + delivery total weight).</p>

<h2>Design -> Development -> Delivery</h2>

<p>The design phase focuses on planning and visual elements, such as diagrams, logos, and icons. The development phase is where execution takes place, and code is written. The delivery phase involves presenting the project, such as deploying websites, uploading plugins, and publishing applications to the appropriate stores or marketplaces.</p>
